# Flipkart GRID Challenge

My Submission for the competition conducted by flipkart in Feb 2019 for object localisation on a datset that they gave. The competition format was similar to Kaggle.

## CONTEST STAGES

The 2019 edition of GRiD contains a four-tier challenge. Participants need to complete the first three stages to qualify and enter the Final Stage of the challenge.

### Level 1: Machine Learning Quiz

All registered teams will have to take an online machine learning quiz.
This quiz is scheduled for 28th January'19, 22:00 hours.
Every team will get a set of 20 questions to be answered within 30 minutes.
All teams will be taking this quiz simultaneously during the quiz window.
Every team will be ranked on accuracy (score) and speed (finish time). This means that if two teams have the same score, then the team that finished earlier will be ranked higher.
Results for this level will be declared within 48 hours of quiz window.
Participating teams will move on to the next level based on their performance in this assessment.

### Level 2: Online Machine Learning Challenge - Medium Complexity Data-set

Shortlisted teams from level 1 will have to participate in an online machine learning challenge.
You'll be given a problem statement with medium complexity data-sets to create your prediction model.
You'll be able to make submissions until the deadline for this round anytime during the challenge window.
Participating teams in this level will move on to the next level based on their performance.
Problem Overview: The 2019 GRiD challenge for students is to leverage a predefined data-set from Flipkart to build a model for Object Localization in images. More details about the problem statement will be released during the relevant rounds.

### Level 3: Online Machine Learning Challenge - High Complexity Data-set

Shortlisted teams from level 2 will have to participate in an online machine learning challenge.
You'll be given a problem statement with a High complexity data-set to create your prediction model.
You'll be able to make submissions until the deadline for this level anytime during the challenge window.
Top 10 teams will move on to the final level based on their performance.
General Guidelines for Level 3


### National Finale:

In the final level of the GRID, finalists will be invited to the Flipkart Headquarters in Bangalore for the last round of evaluation from Flipkart Data Scientists and Engineering panel.
